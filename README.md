# Quotes Analysis and Dashboard Project

## Introduction
In this project, we explore the process of web scraping using Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup and requests to extract data from websites. The extracted data is stored in CSV files for further analysis and manipulation. Additionally, we perform insightful analyses and create interactive dashboards to visualize trends, patterns, and insights derived from the extracted data.

## Aims and Objectives
### Aims:
- To demonstrate the process of web scraping for data extraction from websites.
- To showcase the capabilities of storing extracted data in CSV files for further analysis.
- To create insightful analyses and visualizations to uncover trends and patterns in the data.
- To design and develop interactive dashboards for presenting the analyzed data in a user-friendly manner.

### Objectives:
1. **Data Extraction:** Utilize BeautifulSoup and requests to extract data from target websites.
2. **Data Storage:** Store the extracted data in CSV files for organized access.
3. **Data Analysis:** Perform exploratory data analysis and derive actionable insights from the extracted data.
4. **Dashboard Creation:** Design and develop interactive dashboards using visualization tools like Plotly and Looker Studio.

## Steps of the Project
1. **Data Extraction:** Identify target websites, extract relevant data using web scraping techniques.
2. **Data Storage:** Store the extracted data in CSV files, ensuring proper organization and accessibility.
3. **Data Analysis:** Perform statistical analysis, data visualization, and exploratory data analysis to uncover insights.
4. **Dashboard Creation:** Design and develop interactive dashboards to present the analyzed data in a visually appealing manner.

## Dataset
### Data Selection:
The dataset for this project will be extracted from specific websites relevant to the chosen domain or topic of interest. These websites may include news portals, e-commerce platforms, or social media networks, depending on the objectives of the project.

### Data Limitations:
- Acknowledge the limitations of web scraping, including potential legal and ethical considerations.
- Perform data extraction responsibly, respecting the terms of service and copyright regulations of the target websites.

### Ethics of Data Source:
- Obtain consent from website owners and respect user privacy.
- Ensure compliance with relevant regulations such as GDPR.
