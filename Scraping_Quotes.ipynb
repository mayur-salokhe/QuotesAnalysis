    "# 1. Aims, objectives and background\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's digital age, the internet serves as a vast repository of information, offering invaluable insights into various domains. Web scraping, the process of extracting data from websites, has emerged as a powerful tool for gathering structured data from the vast expanse of the internet. In this project, we leverage the capabilities of web scraping using Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup and requests to extract data from websites of interest. By harnessing this data, we aim to perform insightful analyses and create interactive dashboards to visualize trends, patterns, and insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2. Aims and objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to achieve the following objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To familiarize ourselves with web scraping techniques using BeautifulSoup and requests, understanding their capabilities and limitations.\n",
    "2. To extract data from a target website efficiently and effectively, ensuring accuracy and reliability in the retrieved information.\n",
    "3. To store the extracted data in a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file format, facilitating easy access and manipulation for data analysis purposes.\n",
    "4. To explore the selected dataset, identifying patterns, trends, and insights through exploratory data analysis techniques.\n",
    "5. To critically assess the dataset, considering factors such as data selection criteria, limitations, and the ethics of data sourcing.\n",
    "\n",
    "By accomplishing these objectives, I aim to demonstrate the practical application of web scraping tools in data extraction and analysis, while also emphasizing the importance of ethical considerations and data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3. Steps of the project\n",
    "1. Data Extraction: Utilize BeautifulSoup and requests to extract data from the target website, adhering to web scraping best practices and handling potential challenges such as dynamic content and anti-scraping measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data Storage: Store the extracted data in a CSV file format, organizing it into appropriate columns and ensuring data consistency and integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Data Analysis: Perform exploratory data analysis on the extracted dataset, employing statistical and visual techniques to uncover insights, trends, and anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Dataset Assessment: Evaluate the selected dataset, considering factors such as data relevance, completeness, and potential biases. Reflect on the limitations of the data and discuss ethical considerations surrounding its use.\n",

    "### Data Selection: \n",
    "The dataset selected for this project will be sourced from a publicly available website, chosen based on its relevance to the project objectives and feasibility of data extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Limitations: \n",
    "While web scraping can provide access to vast amounts of data, it's important to acknowledge its limitations, including potential inconsistencies, inaccuracies, and legal or ethical concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ethics of Data Source: \n",
    "Prioritize ethical considerations when extracting data from websites, respecting terms of service, copyright laws, and privacy regulations. Ensure transparency and accountability in data sourcing and usage practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "By adhering to best practices in web scraping and data handling, this project aims to demonstrate the value of ethical and responsible data extraction and analysis in the digital age.\n"
